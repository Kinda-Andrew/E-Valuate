# E-Valuate

E-valuateâ€™s main purpose is to provide eco-friendly evaluations for a variety of users. It breaks down into 2 components, Eco-Vision and Scout.

Eco-vision is oriented towards individual or small-scale use; it allows a user to upload an image of an outdoor space and receive key recommendations for making it more sustainable and environmentally friendly. 

Scout is oriented to be an enterprise-grade tool for expanding solar infrastructure. It allows a user to highlight a region on its map and receive information on how many solar panels could fit in the region based on the approximate roof space, and it gives an estimate for how much energy the infrastructure would provide in a year.
